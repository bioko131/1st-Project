oProject Description
This app is intended to be used as a prototype and to start only in the Austin Area.

Sources from HomeAway and Eventful Databases.

The main purpose of this app is to show the user:
What events in Austin and where to stay HomeAway, or
Where to stay HomeAway and what events, or
Where to stay HomeAway and what events going on at the same time
Based on a predetermined homestay, show events in the area that are happening during the user’s stay
Ex: The user wants to spend a weekend in Austin at a specific homestay, but they don’t know what to do or when to stay. They can search for that specific homestay and time frame and a list and/or map will populate with events in the area around the homestay during that time.
Or, based on an event that the user is attending, show homestay rentals in the area that they can use before, during, and after the event
Ex: Someone is going to a concert at Circuit of the  Americas and wants to find a place to stay the night before. By entering their event info, the website will populate a list of homestays in the area for that time.
